numpy: Used for numerical computations, particularly arrays and basic operations like mean.
pandas: Not used in this specific code but could be used if the data were in a DataFrame format.
matplotlib.pyplot: Used to plot the original data, trend, and seasonality.

n = len(data): Calculates the total number of data points in the time series.
m_t = np.zeros(n): Initializes an array m_t with zeros of the same length as data, which will store the calculated trend.
for t in range(q, n - q): Loops through the middle of the dataset, skipping the first and last q points because the moving average window extends beyond the boundaries for those points.
np.mean(data[t-q:t+q+1]): Calculates the mean of 2*q + 1 data points centered at index t (the moving average).
return m_t: Returns the trend array m_t

n = len(data): Length of the data.
m_t = np.zeros(n): Initialize a zero array to store the trend.
d = 2 * q: The window size for the moving average is calculated (even number).
for t in range(q, n - q): Loops through the data as in the odd case, skipping q points on either end.
m_t[t] = (0.5 * data[t-q] + np.sum(data[t-q+1:t+q]) + 0.5 * data[t+q]) / d: Calculates the moving average for an even window. The first and last points in the window are weighted by 0.5. The rest of the points are summed and divided by the window size d.

n = len(data): Get the total number of data points.
w_k = np.zeros(n): Initialize an array to store the seasonality and irregularity (w_k).
for k in range(n): Loop through each data point.
summation = 0, count = 0: Initialize variables to sum the detrended values and count how many points are valid.
for j in range(-(n // d), n // d): Loop through multiple periods (denoted by d).
if 0 <= k + j*d < n: Ensure the calculated index remains within bounds.
summation += data[k + j*d] - trend[k + j*d]: Subtract the trend from the data point to detrend it, then add this detrended value to summation.
w_k[k] = summation / count: Calculate the average of the detrended values for the current time point.

n = len(w_k): Get the length of w_k.
avg_w = np.mean(w_k): Compute the mean of w_k to remove any irregularity from the data.
g_k = np.zeros(n): Initialize an array to store the seasonality component (g_k).
for k in range(n): Loop through each data point.
g_k[k] = w_k[k] - avg_w: Subtract the mean of w_k to isolate the pure seasonal component (g_k).

data = np.array([...]): Example time series data (replace it with your data).
q = int(input("enter q value: ")): Prompts the user to input a value for q, which is the window size for the moving average.
if len(data) % 2 == 1: Checks if the data length is odd or even to apply the appropriate moving average function.
trend = moving_average_odd(data, q) or moving_average_even(data, q): Calculates the trend depending on the data length.
w_k = calculate_w_k(data, trend, q): Calculates the seasonality and irregularity component.
g_k = calculate_g_k(w_k, q): Calculates the pure seasonality component by removing the irregularity.

plt.subplot(311): Creates the first plot showing the original data.
plt.subplot(312): Creates the second plot showing the calculated trend.
plt.subplot(313): Creates the third plot showing the seasonality.
plt.show(): Displays the plots.
