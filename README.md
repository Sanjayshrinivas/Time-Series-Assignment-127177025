numpy: Provides numerical operations (e.g., handling arrays).
pandas: Used for handling and analyzing structured data, like CSV files.
matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating visualizations (plots/graphs).

input: Prompts the user to enter the file path of a CSV file.
pd.read_csv: Reads the specified CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (df).

Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame: df.head(): Displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame to give the user an overview of the data.

Prompts the user to select the time series column: The user inputs the column name from the CSV file that contains the time series data.

Extracts the time series data: df[column_name]: Accesses the selected column from the DataFrame.
.values: Converts the column into a NumPy array.

Prompts the user to enter q: q is the half-window size for the moving average that will be used to smooth the time series (for trend calculation). It’s used to decide how many points around the central point to include in the moving average calculation.

Initializes necessary variables:
n: The length of the time series.
Tline = np.zeros(n): Initializes an array of zeros of the same length as the time series. This array will store the trend values after they are calculated.

If the length of the time series is odd: The code checks whether the length of the time series is odd (% 2 == 1). If it is, it applies a simple moving average with a window size of 2q + 1. For each index i from q to n-q, it takes a slice from i-q to i+q+1 (this creates a window of size 2q+1), computes the mean of these values, and assigns it to Tline[i].

If the length of the time series is even: If the length of the time series is even, a different approach is used for the moving average:
d = 2 * q: The window size is set to 2q (since it’s even). A weighted moving average is calculated: The first and last elements in the window (i-q and i+q) are weighted by 0.5. The middle elements are summed using np.sum. The weighted sum is then divided by d (the window size).

Computes the seasonal component: seasonal_effect = np.zeros(n): Initializes an array of zeros to store the seasonal effect for each point.
The outer loop iterates over each index i in the time series. For each i, the code computes the difference between the original time series and the trend (time_series[i + j * q] - Tline[i + j * q]). The differences are averaged over multiple periods (calculated using j * q steps), and the average is stored in seasonal_effect[i]. count ensures that only valid indices are used (those that lie within the bounds of the time series).

Removes the mean seasonality: avg_seasonality = np.mean(seasonal_effect): Computes the mean of the seasonal effects. adjusted_seasonal = seasonal_effect - avg_seasonality: Removes the mean seasonality from the seasonal component to ensure it is centered around zero.

Prints the calculated trend and seasonal components: The trend (Tline) and the seasonality (adjusted_seasonal) are displayed in the console.

Creates a figure and subplot for the original data: plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)): Initializes a plot with a figure size of 10x6 inches. plt.subplot(311): Creates a 3-row, 1-column subplot, and selects the first subplot. plt.plot(time_series, label="Original Data"): Plots the original time series data and labels it as "Original Data". plt.legend(loc='upper left'): Adds a legend in the upper left corner of the plot.
